# CRA-MUSEUM
> The CRA-Museum App is developed by Dave Regg and built for those of us who cannot visit the Rijksmuseum in person. For that reason, users may search for an artist or painting, display search results, and get a close-up view of that painting with some details about the painting.

## General info
The Museum Gallery is created and maintained by me, Dave Regg. It was created for the purpose of not only revamping the existing [Museum App](https://github.com/drregg6/museum-app) created in 2019, but to also make use of my [Create-React-App Boilerplate](https://github.com/drregg6/cra-redux-boilerplate) to see if everything works. The main purpose of The Museum Gallery is to give users an experience through the [Rijksmuseum API](https://rijksmuseum.nl), allowing them to search for an artist or painting and to get details of those paintings that are available through the API.
